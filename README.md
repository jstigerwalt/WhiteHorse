# WhiteHorse
WhiteHorse created for Crashes found by MSRD along with Exploits created based on these Crashes.

All information exposed in this Github is free to use. The idea behind this is help others by showing crashes found by fuzzing long with some exploits that have been created based on those crashes.

All content is focused to share my years of experience with other security professionals who are interested in fuzzing and exploit development.

It is your responsibility if you decide to use the information of this blog to make illegal actions. If you do that I am not to blame.
